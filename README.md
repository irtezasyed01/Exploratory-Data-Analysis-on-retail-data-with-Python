Perform exploratory data analysis on retail data with Python


## Overview

The Online Retail dataset is studied and Exploratory data analysis is done on it using Python programming language with the help of Google-Collaboratory platform.

Objective of the analysis:

My objective is to gain insights into the Online Retail Dataset to improve its Sales by knowing its sales trends.

## Project Scenario

In this project, I have worked with transactional data from an online retail store. The dataset contains information about customer purchases, including product details, quantities, prices, and timestamps. Your task is to explore and analyze this dataset to gain insights into the store's sales trends, customer behavior, and popular products. 

By conducting exploratory data analysis, you will identify patterns, outliers, and correlations in the data, allowing you to make data-driven decisions and recommendations to optimize the store's operations and improve customer satisfaction. Through visualizations and statistical analysis, you will uncover key trends, such as the busiest sales months, best-selling products, and the store's most valuable customers. Ultimately, this project aims to provide actionable insights that can drive strategic business decisions and enhance the store's overall performance in the competitive online retail market.

## Project Objectives

* Describe data to answer key questions to uncover insights
* Gain valuable insights that will help improve online retail performance
* Provide analytic insights and data-driven recommendations


The challenge was to conduct an exploratory data analysis to help make key business decisions. To do this, we load, clean, process, analyze, and visualize data. We also pose questions and seek to answer them meaningfully using the dataset provided.

In this project, I used a data set that contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail.
